# gh-deployment-workflow
GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.
----
You can access the [website here](https://rom-let.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/).

To build this, Iâ€¯followed this [starter workflow](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/static.yml).

GitHub automatically deploy code to pages by default, and there is no way to avoid that.
Anyway, here is a proof that it deployed using what I built :

And here is a proof that it ran as intended :

This project idea was provided by [Roadmap.sh](roadmap.sh) here : [https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow].
